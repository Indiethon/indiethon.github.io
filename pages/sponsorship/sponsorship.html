            <h3>Sponsoring Our Main Events</h3>
            <p>
                Indiethon's charity streams are where the action is at! During selected weekends, we put on a large
                online speedrunning event showcasing any and all indie games to raise money for some awesome charities!
                We usually get an average of 150 concurrent viewers and thousands of impressions, this is the best way
                to reach a large audience while still connecting with the indie game community!
            </p>

            <h3>Indie Game Showcase Streams</h3>
            <p>New this year, Indiethon is starting to run small streams to provide entertainment and audience
                engagement
                between our main events. The advantage with this is that you get a dedicated stream for your game to
                show off to a new audience. Some examples of content that can be ran are speed showcases, new game
                speedrunning challenges, beat the record events, and more!
            </p>
            <li>Have a dedicated stream to yourself to explain and advertise your game</li>
            <li>Content shown must be speedrunning-related in some fashion</li>
            <li>Sponsors are required to find willing participants for the stream</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h4 class="question">What advertising formats do you offer?</h4>
        <p>We are currently able to show your logo on our layouts, have pre-written
            advertisements read live by hosts, and play video advertisements during intermission. Depending on the
            sponsor, we usually do all three of these things. If none of these formats fits your needs, please reach out
            and we can discuss what would work best for you.</p>
        <h4 class="question">Why do you charge a small fee for the main events?</h4>
        <p>We ask our sponsors to pay us a small fee in order to cover some of our operating costs. While Indiethon is
            small, we have costs associated with the running of our business and events. Historically, the majority of
            these expenses have been paid out-of-pocket by the organizers, but as we start to grow we've realized that
            it's not sustainable to run things this way and are actively trying to move away from that model. If are
            concerned/not able to pay this fee, please reach out and we can negotiate something that is favorable for
            both
            parties.</p>
        <h4 class="question">Are there any special requirements for each sponsorship type?</h4>
        <p>For the main events, if the sponsoring entity is a video game or similar, we ask that the video game that
            will be advertised is an indie title. Otherwise, any sponsoring entity that is not a video game (video game
            products/services or other non-video game entity) are allowed to sponsor all or a portion of our events.
        </p>
        <p>For our Indie Game Showcase Streams, the sponsoring entity must be a video game or similar that is considered
            an indie title AND the content shown must be related to speedrunning.</p>
        <h4 class="question">I don't like to use the word "sponsor", can you use another term to describe our agreement?
        </h4>
        <p>Absolutely! Some of our sponsors don't like to be referred to as "sponsors", and that's totally fine. In the
            past, we have publicly referred to some sponsors as "supporters" instead. Of course, if you have another
            term
            you'd like us to use instead, we'd be happy to do so.
        </p>
        <h4 class="question">What happens if there's a content disagreement between me and Indiethon?
        </h4>
        <p>While working together, we hope to never have a disagreement between ourselves and our sponsors. However, we
            understand that sometimes our needs don't align with their needs. In that case, we will work together to
            find
            a common middle ground that accomplishes the goals of both parties. But, please remember that our main goal
            is to
            promote indie game speedrunning content, as well as raising money for awesome charities during our main
            events, and we reserve the right to have final say on what is shown on our
            channel.
