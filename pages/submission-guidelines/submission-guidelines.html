    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>Runners must adhere to these rules in order to have their submission be considered valid. We will not consider
        submissions that break one or more of these rules.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Runners and games must be eligible to appear according to <a
                href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">Twitch's Terms of Service</a>.

    </ul>
    <h1>How to Submit</h1>
    <p>We only accept game submissions through <a href="https://v1.oengus.io" target="_blank">Oengus</a>. You must
        create an account by linking a Discord or Twitch account before continuing.</p>
    <p>If the submissions period is open for one of our events, the link to submit will appear on our <a href="/"
            data-link>home</a> page, under event information and game submissions. Once there, if you're logged in, a
        big "Submit Runs" button will appear on the main page and the side navigation menu. Clicking that button will
        take you to the submissions form. From there, follow the form to enter your availability, answer the questions,
        and enter your game information.</p>
    <p>Once you submitted, if you need to make any changes, or add another game, click on the "Edit Submission" button
        on the main page or side navigation. You will only be able to edit your submission while the submission period
        is open.</p>
    <p>If you need help, please feel free to reach out to one of our staff members on Discord.</p>
    <h1>Games</h1>
    <p>For our marathons, we are looking for indie games. According to Wikipedia, a indie game is "a video game
        typically created by individuals or smaller development teams without the financial and technical support of a
        large game
        publisher". However, this isn't a hard definition, as there are many edge cases.
        The game's age or popularity doesn't matter to us.
        If you aren't sure if your game fits this definition, submit it anyway and let us be the judge!</p>
    <p>Not only are we looking for indie games, we're also accepting game mods and flash games! For your submission to
        be considered, your game mod must change a
        large portion of the gameplay/world/other elements. Mods that change graphics, items, etc.. aren't acceptable as
        they don't change enough of the game. Game mods <b>do not</b> have to be based on an indie game.</p>
    <p>We would also like to invite you to think outside the box when considering what to submit. While traditional
        speedruns
        represent the bulk of what we accept, we are open and actively encourage runners to submit alternate forms of
        speedruns, such
        as unique showcases, feats of skill, community projects, bingos, or just silly fun.
    </p>
    <h4>Examples of Acceptable Games</h4>
    <p>The following list of games is a general list of example games that we deem acceptable for the marathon. This is
        <b>not</b> a list of the only games we accept, this list is merely an example of what types of games we may
        accept.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Celeste</li>
        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
        <li>Undertale</li>
        <li>Kaizo Mario series</li>
        <li>ROM Hacks</li>
        <li>Flash/Internet games</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of Past Accepted Games</h4>
    <p>The following list of games are examples of games that we have accepted in the past. Please note the
        non-traditional
        speedrun submissions, such as Super Metroid: Assent and Granny Strikes Back.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ElecHead</li>
        <li>Calico</li>
        <li>Hades</li>
        <li>Super Metroid: Assent (ROM hack)</li>
        <li>Granny Strikes Back (flash game)</li>
        <li>Sonic and the Fallen Star (community-made game)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Disallowed Games</h4>
    <p>The following list of games are unsuitable for our events and will not be considered during the submissions
        process. Please refrain from submitting these titles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Indie titles.</li>
        <li>Games with an ESRB rating of Adults Only.</li>
        <li>Any game that is prohibited on <a
                href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/list-of-prohibited-games?language=en_US"
                target="_blank">Twitch</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>This is not an exhaustive list, games may be added or removed at the discretion of Indiethon staff.</i></p>
    <h1>Unreleased Games</h1>
    <p>At the moment, we do not accept games that release after the submissions period has closed. As we grow, this may
        change in the future.</p>
    <h1>Incentives and Bidwars</h1>
    <p>Donation incentives and bidwars are a fun way for viewers to interact with and/or add content to your run while
        raising money for a good cause. From character name changes to adding entire bonus games, anything is possible!
    </p>
    <p>Possible donation incentives and bidwars can be entered through the submission form. While we do ask for them on
        the form, incentives and bidwars are <b>not</b> taken into account in the selection process. Don't worry if you
        don't have an incentive while submitting, we review incentives separately after the schedule has been made, and
        will ask for more incentives ideas before the start of the event.</p>
    <p>Incentives should not add more than 5-6 minutes to your run; expectations may be made on a case-by-case basis. By
        submitting an incentive, you're committing to performing it if selected. Not taking this seriously may affect
        future submissions to Indiethon.</p>
    <h1>Tech Requirements</h1>
    <p>To ensure we keep a smooth and high-quality experience for our viewers, we maintain a number of tech requirements
        for our runners. Please make sure you meet these requirements before submitting to one of our events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be able to maintain a stable stream at 720p 30fps 1500kbps.</li>
        <li>You must be able to stream to a RTMP server. If you're not using OBS, SLOBS, or XSplit, please ensure that
            your streaming software supports this functionality.</li>
        <li>You must have an acceptable internet speed to maintain your stream, around 10Mbps or above is good.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tech requirements do not apply if you're submitting for an in-person event.</p>
    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
    <h4>Commentary</h4>
    <p>Commentary in submission videos is highly recommended but not necessary. Videos without proper commentary are
        acceptable but may be looked at more unfavorably compared to submissions with proper commentary. Swearing in
        commentary is fine, but we expect that your commentary is clean if we accept your run.</p>
    <h4>Submission Video</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you submit a separate video or a past marathon run instead of submitting a simple personal best
        for your submission video. This allows us to more properly judge your run, commentary and overall entertainment
        value.</p>
    <h4>Estimates</h4>
    <p>An estimate is a time that you think you can realistically complete the run in. This time should <b>not</b> be
        your personal best. Your estimate should be in real time (not in-game time or an alternative timing method), and
        should take
        into account everything that could go wrong in your run, including (but not limited to) RNG and difficult
        tricks. It is much better to err on the side of caution instead of submitting an inaccurate time in the hopes of
        impressing our submission team.</p>
    <h4>Consoles and Emulators</h4>
    <p>If possible, we ask that you submit a run done on original hardware. However, we understand that this may not be
        possible for some runners, therefore we will accept emulator runs if emulators are generally allowed on your
        game's community/leaderboard.</p>
    <h4>Facecams</h4>
    <p>To maintain the overall quality of the stream, we suggest adding a facecam to your submission video. Vtubers,
        input displays, or similar may be accepted as a substitution for a facecam, however they must be reliable and of
        good quality. Not having a facecam is fine but may impact your submission, especially if we receive multiple
        submissions for the same game.</p>
    <h1>What We Look For in Submissions</h1>
    <p>Each event, we get a lot of submissions. That unfortunately means we can't accept everything. Below are a couple
        of major factors (in no particular order) that we consider when deciding whether the game will be a good fit in
        our final schedule. Note that we don't always take <i>every</i> factor into consideration, for example there are
        many entertaining games that have no fundraising potential.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fundraising Potential</li>
        <li>Entertainment Value</li>
        <li>Commentary Quality</li>
        <li>Run Length</li>
        <li>Past Appearances</li>
        <li>Runner History</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fundraising Potential</h4>
    <p>The main goal of our events is to raise money for some awesome charitable causes. Therefore, we take into account
        what factors (if any) will help motivate viewers to donate to the cause. Things like the game's popularity,
        enticing donation incentives, bid wars, Crowd Control oppunitunity, or other unique fundraising ideas help in
        this regard.</p>
    <h4>Entertainment Value</h4>
    <p>In our eyes, entertainment value means how entertaining the game itself is. Fun and exciting games are much
        better suited for a marathon than boring and repetitive games. Unique tricks, fun visuals, or a
        exciting twist or alternate submissions (TAS, rhythm games, score attacks) help immensely in this realm.</p>
    <h4>Commentary Quality</h4>
    <p>Having good and exciting commentary is the biggest factor that keeps viewers engaged with the stream. This factor
        is ever more apparent in longer games, co-op/race submissions, and unique showcases. This is usually the
        deciding factor when selecting games, therefore we highly recommend including good commentary with your
        submission.</p>
    <h4>Run Length</h4>
    <p>Longer runs may be harder to fit into our schedule as they displace multiple shorter runs. We try to accept a
        a couple of long runs each event, but the reality is we only have a finite time in our schedule. Length also plays
        a large factor in cases where a game is submitted by multiple runners, or there are multiple categories
        submitted for the same game.</p>
    <h4>Past Appearances</h4>
    <p>To keep our run lineup varied, we take into account how recently a game was shown at one of our past events.
        Having the same game shown over and over isn't really fun or entertaining. We may make an exception based on
        other
        factors in the submission process.</p>
    <h4>Runner History</h4>
    <p>To ensure that the runner is a good fit for our events, we take into account their past actions and history with
        Indiethon. Runners who have previously been unreliable or disrespectful to others may be looked at more
        unfavorably.</p>
