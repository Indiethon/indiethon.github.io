    <p>Thank you for your interest in donating to Indiethon. You can find our donation options below.</p>
    <p>Currently, our event is majority supported by the financial support by both of the organizers, nicnacnic and
        thedmpanda. This is clearly not sustainable in the long
        term and hinders our ability to grow. We thank you for donating to our company so that we can continue to put on some great charity events.
