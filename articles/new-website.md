After countless hours of typing and smashing keybaords, Indiethon finally has a proper website! Inspired by nicnacnic's [personal portfolio](https://nicolasbaror.com), this website serves as a place where information about us and our company can be found. You will be able to find information about our upcoming events, guides to all aspects of our events, our history, and contact info, among other things.

Preferred the old website? It is still up at [oldsite.indiethon.com](https://oldsite.indiethon.com). There's not much there and it will probably be deleted at some point, so get your nostalgia in now.

We hope that you'll enjoy using this website, and make sure to check back periodically for updated event dates and news. If you find any issues with this new website, please feel free to contact the webmaster. Contact info is availiable on the [contact page](/contact).
