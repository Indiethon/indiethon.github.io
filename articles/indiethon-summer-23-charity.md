We're excited to announce that Indiethon Summer 2023 will be raising money for The Samaritans! They are a UK-based charity that provide phone lines, online chat rooms, and a self-help app to provide support for those who are having suicidal thoughts. Every day, Samaritans volunteers respond to 10,000 calls for help, and talk to those people to make them feel better about themselves. You can find out more about their efforts to help people affected by suicidal thoughts on their website at [https://www.samaritans.org/](https://www.samaritans.org/).

If you are having suicidal thoughts, please contact The Samaritans in the UK at 116 123, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline in the US at 988, or find your country's hotline here: [https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/)
