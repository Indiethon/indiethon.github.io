After a thrilling weekend of awesome speedruns shown off by highly skilled runners, Indiethon Summer 2023 has come to a close! Through our efforts and the generosity of our viewers, we were able to raise a total of $805 for The Samaritans! While we fell short of our event goal, this is very exciting nonetheless, as all money raised goes directly to help people get through some tough times in their lives. The money raised during the event is enough to keep their call centers open for an hour and a half and help save lives.

We would like to thank everyone who helped, participated, and supported our event. Without you guys, our event would not happen. We would also like to thank the companies that support us financially, such as Team17. They also provided some of the amazing prize packs that we were able to give away. Finally, we would like to thank Rachel Henderson and the entire team from Stream for Samaritans for their help and support in getting our event off the ground.

Thank you to everyone once again for your support, and make sure to keep up with all our social channels as we will be periodically posting important information regarding our next event. See you next time!
